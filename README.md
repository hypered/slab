# Slab

Slab is a programmable markup language to generate HTML.

```
$ cat data/values.json
[
  {
    "username": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  },
  {
    "username": "Bob",
    "email": "bob@example.com"
  }
]

$ cat example.slab
frag hello(name)
  li.greeting
    p Hello, #(name).
    content

let values = ./data/values.json
ul
  for value in values
    hello(value['username'])
      p Some content.

$ slab render --pretty example.slab
<ul>
    <li class="greeting">
        <p>
            Hello, Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some content.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="greeting">
        <p>
            Hello, Bob.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some content.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
```

You can think of Slab as HTML + functions and imports, and read more about it at
[slab-lang.org](https://slab-lang.org/).

# Development

Slab is written in Haskell and this repository provides a Nix-based development
environment. Running `scripts/ghci.sh` automatically enters a Nix shell with
the necessary dependencies and configures GHCi to make working on Slab easier:

```
$ scripts/ghci.sh
Welcome to Slab's GHCi environment.

Type :about to see this help text.

Other interesting commands and expressions include:

    :main --help
    runExamples

Discover the code base with e.g.:

    :doc runExamples
    :i about
    :e tests/Slab/GHCi.hs

→
```

The main command for a user of Slab is the `build` command. But Slab also
offers commands to better understand and debug its various stages (parsing,
preprocessing, evaluating, running external commands, and rendering).

slab - A programmable markup language to generate HTML

Usage: slab COMMAND

  Slab is a programmable markup language to generate HTML.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  build                    Build a library of Slab templates to HTML
  watch                    Watch and build a library of Slab templates to HTML
  serve                    Watch and serve a library of Slab templates to HTML
  report                   Analyse a library of Slab templates
  render                   Render a Slab template to HTML
  run                      Execute a Slab template
  evaluate                 Evaluate a Slab template
  parse                    Parse a Slab template to AST
  generate                 Generate code corresponding to a Slab template
  classes                  Parse a Slab template and report its CSS classes
  fragments                Parse a Slab template and report its fragments
```

Note: GHCi is an Haskell interpreter. Within GHCi, instead of calling a
compiled binary (called `slab` in our case), we can call the special command
`:main` and pass it arguments in the same way we would on a regular
command-line.

During development, it helps to create small `.slab` files and run our code on
them. In particular, given an `examples/a.slab` file, we can use `parse` and
`evaluate` to introspect the ASTs at the different stages.

```
ghci> :main parse --shallow examples/a.slab
ghci> :main parse examples/a.slab
ghci> :main evaluate examples/a.slab
ghci> :main evaluate --simplify examples/a.slab
ghci> :main render --pretty examples/a.slab
ghci> :main render examples/a.slab
```

The test cases in `examples/cases/` come from the [original Pug test
suite](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/tree/master/packages/pug/test/cases). The
expected HTML is not exactly the same: we pretty print it differently, or some
tags are explicitely closed in Pug.js (e.g. `<source>` vs. `<source/>`.

Modules from the code base are almost always imported "qualified". For example,
the module `Slab.Parse` is imported within `Slab.Run` as `Parse`. This is
replicated within GHCi too:

```
ghci> :i Parse.parseExpr
ghci> Parse.parseExpr "1 + 2 * a"
```

# Tests

To run the test suite, use the `runExamples` function within GHCi.

To debug a failing test, use `render --pretty`:

```
:main render --pretty examples/fragments.slab
```

The result should match (in this example) `examples/fragments.html`.

# Binary executable test environment

In addition of the above development environment, this repository exposes
another Nix shell where the compiled `slab` program is available, together with
its Bash tab-completion.

```
$ nix-shell default.nix -A shell
$ slab <TAB>
```

# Hackage and library documentation

Slab is [available on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/slab), where
the library documentation is visible.

# Code generation

In addition of generating static HTML files from Slab templates, we explore
generating code.

```
ghci> :main generate a.slab
```

Currently, a very small subset of the Slab language is supported, and only
Haskell code can be generated.

# Why the name

In the context of [memory
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation), slab allocation is
a mechanism designed to reduce fragmentation caused by allocations and
deallocations.

Slab the language is designed to define, combine and, eventually evaluate
fragments to HTML.

# Acknowledgement

Slab was initially a port to Haskell of the [Pug.js](https://pugjs.org)
templating language.
